# Password Generator
## Description: 
This is my password generator assignment

The purpose of this assignment was to create a random password generator that used characters, uppercase and lowercase letters, and special characters. 

## Tech stack: 
I barely touched the HTML and did not touch the CSS, the only changes I made were within javascript. 

### Functions: 
3/4 of the functions use arrays except for the one used to generate numbers. The random password generator is a function that pulls from an array but all the objects in the array are the four functions i built. I had the idea for this and then asked BCS learning assistant to help build the actual function. We tried it with console.log and it worked.
